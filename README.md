# Combinators
+ Second element comes immediately after first element and share the same parent
~ Second element comes anywhere after first element and share the same parent
> Second element is a direct child of first element
 (space): Second element is a descendant of the first element

# Block-level vs Inline Elements
Block-level elements are rendered as a block and hence take up all the available horizontal space: <div> , <section> , <article> , <nav>, <h1>, <p>

Inline elements on the other hand only take up the space they require to fit their content in. Setting a width  or height, margin-top  and margin-bottom  on an inline element also has no effect

You can set display: inline-block  to merge behaviors: <a> , <span> , <img>

# Pseudo classes and elements
: pseudo-class => special state of an element
:: pseudo-name => specific part of an element
